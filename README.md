# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

This repository was created to host the refactored code of the Horiseon landing page. 

The refactoring was completed with a view to enhancing the existing codebase, namely its readability with semantic HTML tags and consolidating its CSS stylesheet.

This process will also boost web accessibility and SEO (search engine optimisation).
